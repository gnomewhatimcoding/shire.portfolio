		<h1>Shire Living</h1>
			<p>Dakota Thompson is my name and I come from the great state of Alaska. The short answer to my life story is that I am still figuring out what I want to do. All I know is that I would like to explore the world.</p>

	<div>

		<h2>Skills and Education</h3>
			<p>I earned my AA degree from Montana State University and attended vocational school for welding. I am learning to code because it will be a wonderful asset for creative work and yield new job opportunities. I am a curious fellow who enjoys learning for its own sake.</p>

		<h3>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I enjoy many activities: breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, supper! My ideal lifestyle would be to live in an earthen home complete with a landscaped yard, roof garden, and a well-stocked pantry. I too have a love for things that grow and enjoy working with plants. As Bilbo would say: "It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life."</p>

		<h4>Goals</h4>	
			<p>1.) Design and build my own Hobbit home.
			   2.) Achieve financial independence by 2030.
			   3.) Make time for both hands-on learning and remote work.
			   4.) Work hard, be nice, notice the little things.</p>

		<h5>A big thank you to <a href="https://onemonth.com/" target="_blank">One Month</a> for offering a quality program at an affordable price. The enthusiasm and clear instruction of learning code is making the experience more enjoyable!
